    Recipe('Easy Thanksgiving Turkey', 'assets/2126711929_ef763de2b3_w.jpg', [
      '''Ingredients: 1 12-20 pound turkey; 1 onion, peeled and quartered; 
      1 lemon, quartered; 1 apple (your favorite kind), quartered; 
      .75 ounce container fresh rosemary; .75 ounce container fresh thyme;
       .75 ounce container fresh sage; 1 cup unsalted butter, softened; 
       1 teaspoon salt; 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper; 
       6-8 cloves garlic, minced; fresh chopped herbs''',
      '''Instructions:
      If the turkey is frozen: Thaw in the fridge, 24 hours for every 5 pounds of Turkey. I like to give myself 1 extra day, just to be safe.
Remove the thawed turkey from the fridge 1 hour before roasting, to let it come to room temperature.
Adjust your oven rack so the turkey will sit in the center of the oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
Make the herb butter by combining room temperature butter, minced garlic, salt, pepper, one tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary, one tablespoon fresh chopped thyme, and half a tablespoon of fresh chopped sage. (You’ll use the remaining fresh herbs for stuffing inside the cavity of the turkey)
Remove turkey from packaging and remove the neck and giblets from the inside the cavities of the bird. (Reserve them for gravy, if you want, or discard them). Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels.
Season the cavity of the turkey with salt and pepper. Stuff it with the quartered lemon, onion and apple and leftover herbs.
Use your fingers to loosen and lift the skin above the breasts (on the top of the turkey) and smooth a few tablespoons of the herb butter underneath.
Tuck the wings of the turkey underneath the turkey and set the turkey on a roasting rack inside a roasting pan*.
Microwave the remaining herb butter mixture for 30 seconds (it doesn’t need to be completely melted--just really softened). Use a basting brush to brush the remaining herb butter all over the outside of the turkey, legs and wings.
Roast at 325 degrees F for about 13-15 minutes per pound, or until internal temperature (inserted on middle of thigh and breast) reaches about 165 degrees. 
(I remove the turkey from the oven once it reaches 160 degrees. Then, I tent it with foil, and let it rest on the counter. It will continue cooking under the foil, to reach 165 degrees F.)
***Check the turkey about halfway through cooking, and once the skin gets golden brown, cover the top of the turkey with tinfoil, to protect the breast meat from overcooking. Alternately, you could start cooking the turkey with it tented in foil, then during the last hour or so of cooking you can take the foil off to let the turkey brown.
Allow turkey to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving.
Reserve any drippings and juice remaining in your roasting pan to make turkey gravy.''',

    Recipe('Garlic herb butter roast turkey',
        'assets/27729023535_a57606c1be.jpg', [
      '''INGREDIENTS:
Roast Turkey:
12 pound (6 kg) whole turkey, skin on (fully defrosted, washed, giblets and neck removed)

3 heads garlic cut in half horizontally divided
3 slices lemon divided
6 sprigs thyme divided
6 sprigs rosemary divided
1/2 cup olive oil divided

Herb Butter:
4 ounces (125 g) unsalted butter
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
4 teaspoons minced garlic
Salt
Cracked Pepper''',
      '''
INSTRUCTIONS:
Preheat oven to 425°F | 220°C for standard ovens, or 390°F | 200°C for fan forced. Lower oven shelf to the lowest part of your oven.
Combine the Herb Butter ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Reserve half of the herb butter in the refrigerator for later.
Line a large roasting pan with foil or parchment paper. Arrange the 4 halves of garlic cut-side down on the bottom of the pan with 4 sprigs each of thyme and rosemary, half of the olive oil and 1 slice of lemon.
Thoroughly pat turkey dry with paper towels. Stuff with the remaining heads garlic halves, lemon slice, a squeeze of lemon from remaining slice, herbs and a drizzle of olive oil. 
Melt the butter and rub all over the turkey, including under the skin. Season generously all over with salt and pepper. Place turkey on top of the garlic and herbs in the pan BREAST-SIDE DOWN. Drizzle with the remaining oil.
Roast uncovered for 30 minutes for a small turkey under 13 pounds (6 1/2 kg), or 45 minutes for a larger turkey over 14 pounds (7 kg plus).
Turn turkey over (breast-side up) with a pair of tongs, a clean tea towel or oven mits (heat-proof gloves) and baste with pan juices.
Spread half of the reserved herb butter over the top of your turkey with a spoon or brush (be careful, the turkey will be hot and the butter will melt nicely over the skin). Pour any remaining juices over your turkey.
Reduce heat to 325°F |165°C (for standard ovens), or 300°F | 150°C (fan-forced). Roast, uncovered, for an hour.
Slather turkey generously with remaining butter and roast for 30 minutes. Baste again, then continue roasting for a further 30 minutes or so, depending on the size of your bird. *Tent loosely with foil if starting to brown too fast.*
(For an extra large turkey, you may need an additional half hour to an hour.)
For extra crispy skin, broil (or grill) in the last 5-10 minutes, keeping your eye on it so it doesn't burn, until the skin is crispy and golden browned all over.
Tent turkey with foil and allow it to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving and serving.
Remove 2 1/2 cups of the liquid from the pan juices (top up with stock if you need too), strain and reserve for your gravy.

      '''INGREDIENTS:
300g pecans, finely crushed but not powdery, plus 100g extra to garnish
1 1/ 2 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 freshly grated nutmeg
20 sheets fresh filo pastry

500g caster sugar
60g glucose syrup
2 cinnamon quills
2 tbs lemon juice''',
      '''METHOD:
1.Preheat oven to 150°C. For the syrup, place all ingredients and 300ml water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring, for 3-5 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and cool.
2.Place crushed pecan in a bowl with the spices and stir to combine.
3.As filo pastry dries out quickly, it is best to work with a few sheets at a time and then cover the rest with a lightly damp tea towel until ready to use. Brush a sheet of filo with ghee, then sprinkle about 2 tbs of nut and spice mixture on top. Layer with another sheet of filo, brush with ghee and sprinkle over 2 tbs nut mixture. Repeat this process until you have layered 5 sheets of filo with nut and spice mixture. Roll filo into a long log lengthways. Make sure that the roll is not too loose or too tight. Repeat until you have made 4 logs.
4.Cut each log into 2.5cm-wide rounds. Arrange pieces close together with cut sides facing up in a large baking tray with high sides. Bake for 1 hour or until golden brown. Pour the cooled syrup over the hot baklava and let it rest. Sprinkle over extra crushed pecans to garnish.''',
